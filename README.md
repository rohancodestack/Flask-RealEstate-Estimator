# House-Price-Predictor
In this project, I developed a basic model to predict house prices based on a single feature: the area of the property. Due to the simplicity of the dataset, I chose a linear regression algorithm for prediction. After training the model, I saved the parameters in a pickle file and deployed the model to a web application using Flask.
